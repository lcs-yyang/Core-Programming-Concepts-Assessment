 # Question 3
 
 Create a variable of type `Double` called `spendingMoney` that begins at 0.
 
 You will use this to keep track of money you earn and spend while at LCS.
 
 For each point below, **use the correct compound assignment operator** to update your spending money balance.
 
 - Your grandparents give you 50 dollars at the start of September
 - You spend one third of your spending money by going bowling in Peterborough with your housemates
 - You bet your friend that you'll earn a higher mark on a Math test, and you do, so he gives you 10 dollars
 - Your friend bets you that he'll earn a higher mark on the next Science test, and he does, so you give him 10 dollars
 - You spend $5.50 at Foodland on granola bars for the stash of food in your room
 - For the holidays, a kind uncle doubles your spending money
 
 */
// Answer question 3 below
var spendingMoney = 0.0
spendingMoney += 50.0
spendingMoney /= 3.0
spendingMoney += 10.0
spendingMoney -= 10.0
spendingMoney -= 5.50
spendingMoney *= 2.0
print(spendingMoney)
